# Encryption-decryption-with-Basic-RSA-algorithm.-
The RSA algorithm is the most widely used way to encrypt text. I wrote simple codes, 
which encrypts and decrypts text in the easiest way using the basic RSA method.

This code can be used for demonstration. With it you can explain:
--> What is RSA?
--> How Does it works
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As well, the code works without any bugs and you can send cipher text to your friend who also has the same codes.
